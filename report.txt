This investigation looked at a dataset that had details about insurance policies, such as policy ID, number of claims, exposure period, car specs, driver age, and location information. The preprocessing of the dataset included dividing the data into training and testing sets and using one-hot encoding to handle categorical variables. The possibility of a claim being filed was then estimated using a logistic regression model using the given features. On the test set, the model's accuracy was almost 75%, showing that it could correctly categorize insurance policies as either likely or unlikely to result in a claim. To improve prediction performance, more research may entail experimenting with various machine learning algorithms, feature engineering strategies, and model evaluation methodologies.

This research offers insightful information on the features of insurance policies and how likely claims are related to them. Insurance companies can more effectively handle claims and gain a deeper understanding of policyholder risk factors by utilizing machine learning techniques. Furthermore, the results support continuous efforts to boost client satisfaction, increase underwriting accuracy, and optimize insurance operations. Future improvements to predictive models and the addition of new data sources may enhance the ability to estimate insurance risk, which would ultimately help the insurance sector make better decisions and achieve better commercial results.
